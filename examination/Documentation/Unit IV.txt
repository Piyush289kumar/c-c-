Question 1: What is Linked List?

Answer: A Linked List is a linear data structure which looks like a chain of nodes, where each node is a different element. Unlike Arrays, Linked List elements are not stored at a contiguous location.

It is basically chains of nodes, each node contains information such as data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.
 
There are mainly three types of linked lists:

(1) Single-linked list
(2) Double linked list
(3) Circular linked list

1. Singly-linked list

Traversal of items can be done in the forward direction only due to the linking of every node to its next node.

2. Doubly linked list

Traversal of items can be done in both forward and backward directions as every node contains an additional prev pointer that points to the previous node.

3. Circular linked lists

A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle, there is no NULL at the end.
